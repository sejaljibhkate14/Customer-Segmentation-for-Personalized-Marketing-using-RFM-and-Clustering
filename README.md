🧠 Customer Segmentation for Personalized Marketing using RFM and Clustering
This project focuses on identifying distinct customer groups using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis combined with clustering techniques (like K-Means). The primary objective is to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and provide actionable insights for personalized marketing strategies.

📌 Objectives:
Analyze customer transaction data to understand purchasing patterns.

Use RFM analysis to quantify customer engagement and value.

Apply unsupervised machine learning (clustering) to group customers into meaningful segments.

Help marketing teams tailor campaigns to different customer types (e.g., loyal, at-risk, high-value).

🔍 Techniques Used:
RFM Feature Engineering (Recency, Frequency, Monetary scoring)

K-Means Clustering

Elbow Method / Silhouette Score for choosing optimal clusters

Data Preprocessing (normalization, outlier handling)

Visualization of clusters and customer distributions

📈 Benefits:
Enables data-driven marketing by targeting specific customer segments.

Helps increase customer retention, lifetime value, and conversion rates.

Supports budget optimization by focusing marketing efforts where they matter most.
